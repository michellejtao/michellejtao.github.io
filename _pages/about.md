I am a second-year economics Ph.D. student at Emory University. Prior to Emory, I was a research assistant at the Institute for Fiscal Studies at Tsinghua University. I earned my B.A. in Economics from New York University. My research interests lie in household finance and macroeconomics. Outside of economics, I enjoy [powerlifting](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/michelletao), hiking, and cooking. 

You can contact me via email at [michelle.tao@emory.edu](michelle.tao@emory.edu), or in person (R. Randall Rollins Building 4th floor).
