I am a second-year economics Ph.D. student at Emory University from Hong Kong. Prior to Emory, I was a research assistant at the Institute for Fiscal Studies at Tsinghua University. I earned my B.A. from New York University with a major in Economics and a minor in Politics. My research interests lie in empirical macroeconomics and labor economics. Outside of economics, I enjoy powerlifting, hiking, and cooking.
