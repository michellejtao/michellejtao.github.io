I'm a second-year economics PhD student at Emory University. My research interests lie in macroeconomics and labor economics. Prior to Emory, I was a research assistant at the Institute for Fiscal Studies at Tsinghua University. I earned my B.A. from New York University with a major in Economics and a minor in Politics. Outside of economics, I enjoy powerlifting and cooking.
