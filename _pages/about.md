I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Emory University. I earned my B.A. in Economics from New York University, and previously worked as a research assistant at Tsinghua University. My research interests lie in household finance, urban economics, and real estate. Outside of economics, I enjoy [powerlifting](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/michelletao), hiking, and cooking. 

You can contact me via email at [michelle.tao@emory.edu](mailto:michelle.tao@emory.edu), or in person (R. Randall Rollins Building 4th floor). 

You can also find me on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/TaoMichelle) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michellejtao/).
