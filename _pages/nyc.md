People describe New York City as a revolving door — people come and go, the door keeps spinning, but the city itself remains the same in a lot of ways. It has been more than four years since I was last in New York City, and eight years since I first set foot here. So much has changed, yet so little at the same time.

My favorite restaurant in Chinatown has moved to a bigger location across the street, but the dumplings still taste the same, and the owner is still there. My favorite ice cream shop no longer sells my go-to flavor, but the new options on the menu are just as good. New shops and restaurants have popped up. Some frequently visited shops have closed, while others have remained. But the feel of the city, its pace and its energy, hasn’t really changed. I still feel a sense of awe when the hot wind blows through my hair and the ground rumbles as the train pulls into the station. 

As I walked around, I felt like I knew this place so well, yet I was seeing it with fresh eyes, navigating my way through the streets with Google Maps. The city has kept moving without me, but at the same time, pieces of my old life are scattered across its streets — along the river, by the Central Park reservoir, and in Washington Square Park. It’s a weird feeling to be part of something, but also outside of it. 

Old friends feel like vacuum-sealed memories of who I used to be, or at least a forgotten part of me. I even caught a glimpse of what my life would be like and who I might have become had I stayed. On one hand, conversing with them in familiar banter feels so natural, as if the last few years were on ‘pause’ and we pressed ‘resume’ like nothing had changed. Old memories, jokes, and feelings resurfaced, falling into place as effortlessly as they always had. Yet, at the same time, so much has changed. People change — new jobs, new degrees, new family members. I have changed too — I’m no longer the same person who first stepped through the revolving door eight years ago. The friendships and connections are still there, but they have evolved, just as we have. 

A tourist on the subway platform asked if I live here. I shook my head with a bittersweet smile and offered to help with directions. As the train pulled into the station, the familiar voice over the speakers announced the next stop. This train, which once carried me around the city, now carries me through memories — back to the life I had here and forward to where I am now. As an old friend said, "Appreciate the past, but look forward to the future." I step onto the train, ready for the next stop.
