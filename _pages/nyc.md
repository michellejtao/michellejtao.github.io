It has been more than four years since I was last in NYC, and eight years since I first set foot here. So much has changed, yet so little at the same time.

People describe NYC as a revolving door — people come and go, the door keeps spinning, but the city itself remains the same in a lot of ways. Walking through the streets, I felt like I was stepping back into something familiar, yet slightly different.

My favorite restaurant in Chinatown has moved to a bigger location across the street, but the dumplings still taste the same, and the owner is still there. My favorite ice cream shop no longer sells my go-to flavor, but the new options on the menu are just as good. I didn’t see a single rat in the subway tracks, and I no longer need to carry a metro card or worry about how many swipes I have left. The city still smells of pot and cigarette smoke. I still feel awe when the hot wind blows my hair and the ground rumbles as the train pulls into the station. New shops and restaurants have popped up. Some frequently visited shops have closed, while others have remained. But the feel of the city, its pace, and its energy haven’t really changed.

As I walked around, I felt like I knew this place so well, yet I was seeing it with fresh eyes and navigating my way through with Google Maps. The city has kept moving without me, but at the same time, pieces of my old life are scattered across its streets — along the river, by the Central Park reservoir, and in Washington Square Park. It’s a weird feeling — to be part of something, but also outside of it. It reminded me that just like the city, I’ve changed, but there’s still a part of me that’s rooted here.

Old friends feel like vacuum-sealed memories of who I used to be, or at least a forgotten part of me. I caught a glimpse of what my life would be like and who I might have become if I had stayed. On one hand, conversing with them feels so natural, with familiar banter and old jokes, as if the last few years were on pause and we pressed resume like nothing had changed. Old memories, feelings, and inside jokes resurfaced, falling into place as effortlessly as they always had. Yet, at the same time, so much has. People change — new jobs, new degrees, new family members. I have changed too — I’m no longer the same person who first stepped through that door eight years ago. The friendships and connections are still there, but they have evolved, just as we have. 

A tourist on the subway platform asked if I lived here. I shook my head, gave a bittersweet smile, and offered to help with directions. As the train pulled into the station, the familiar voice over the speakers announced the next stop. This train, which once carried me around the city, now carries me through memories — back to the life I had here and forward to where I am now. As an old friend said, "Appreciate the past, but look forward to the future." I stepped onto the train, ready for the next stop.
