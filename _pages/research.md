##### The Missing Homebuyers: Demographic Changes and Financial Constraints
Abstract: Do mortgage constraints distort homeownership decisions for single borrowers? I show that single borrowers bunch more below regulatory thresholds for debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. When DTI constraints tighten, borrowers are overwhelmingly more likely to exit the market than to adjust their loan size, and single borrowers disproportionately account for these exits: 47% more single borrowers disappear from the market relative to co-borrowers. The large extensive margin response reflects the lumpy nature of housing and the limited availability of smaller, affordable homes due to restrictive zoning regulations. Cross-sectional and difference-in-differences analyses show that single borrowers in more restrictive zoning markets have higher DTI ratios and respond more strongly to relaxations in DTI limits. My findings suggest that the decline in homeownership among young adults is not solely the result of shifting preferences, but also of financial and structural constraints that bind unevenly across a changing population.
