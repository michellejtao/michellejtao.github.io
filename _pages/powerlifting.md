Powerlifting! 

*What is powerlifting?* It is a strength sport that consists of three barbell lifts: back squat, bench press, and deadlift. In a powerlifting competition, you attempt your maximum on each of the three lifts.

*What I like about powerlifting:*
1. It is very quantifiable - easy to track your progress (300lb last week, 315lb today -> 15lb increase)
2. Numbers don't lie - 300lb is 300lb, regardless of how you feel
3. It is simple and `boring' - you do the three lifts (squat, bench, and deadlift) day in day out. If you learn how to do these lifts safely and well, just keep doing it, there's no need to overcomplicate things
4. Progress is slow but consistency matters - this is where I like to draw the parallel between powerlifting and research. It is hard to put on 10lb on your bench press in one day, or complete a project in three days, but we can make incremental progress every day. The lack of immediate progress can feel demoralizing in the process, but making small steps everyday can bring you to your final destination 
5. It's you against yourself - I don't compete to beat other people, I compete against myself
6. Just like any hobby, lifting weights brings me joy and keeps me mentally healthy

*What are your numbers?*
Squat: 150kg (330lb), bench: 65kg (143lb), deadlift: 165kg (363lb).
